<div class="prose">
    <h2>Technology in Service of the Gospel</h2>
    <p>At Christian Alms Outreach, we believe that artificial intelligence, when guided by Christian ethics and values, can be a powerful tool for advancing God's kingdom on Earth. Our approach is thoughtful, prayerful, and always centered on human dignity.</p>
    
    <h2>Theological Perspective</h2>
    
    <h3>Creation and Creativity</h3>
    <p>As beings made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), we possess creative abilities that reflect our Creator. When we develop technology to serve others, we participate in God's ongoing work of creation and redemption.</p>
    
    <h3>Wisdom and Discernment</h3>
    <p>Scripture calls us to be "wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16). This means approaching AI with both enthusiasm for its potential and wisdom about its limitations and risks.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."</p>
        <cite>- Proverbs 9:10</cite>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Our AI Principles</h2>
    
    <div class="grid grid--2" style="margin: var(--spacing-xl) 0;">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>1. Human Dignity First</h3>
            <p>Technology serves people, not the other way around. Every algorithm we deploy must enhance human dignity and respect the image of God in each person.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h3>2. Transparency and Trust</h3>
            <p>We commit to being open about how we use AI, ensuring our methods are understandable and our intentions clear.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h3>3. Justice and Fairness</h3>
            <p>Our AI systems are regularly audited for bias, ensuring they serve all communities equally, especially the marginalized.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h3>4. Privacy and Protection</h3>
            <p>We guard the data entrusted to us as sacred, using it only to serve and never to exploit.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
    
    <h3>How We Use AI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Anticipating community needs before crises occur</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> Ensuring donations reach those who need them most</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identifying trends in poverty and developing targeted interventions</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Breaking down language barriers in service delivery</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Assessing food quality and safety in our distribution centers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What AI Cannot Replace</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The warmth of human compassion</li>
        <li>The power of prayer and spiritual guidance</li>
        <li>The discernment that comes from the Holy Spirit</li>
        <li>The transformative power of personal relationships</li>
        <li>The sacramental nature of Christian charity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Ethical Framework</h2>
    
    <div class="card" style="background: var(--parchment); margin: var(--spacing-xl) 0;">
        <h3>The Three Pillars of Christian AI Ethics</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Love (Agape)</h4>
        <p>Every line of code must be written with love for God and neighbor. Our algorithms optimize not for efficiency alone, but for maximum expression of Christian love.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Wisdom (Sophia)</h4>
        <p>We seek divine wisdom in developing and deploying technology, always questioning not just "can we?" but "should we?"</p>
        
        <h4>3. Service (Diakonia)</h4>
        <p>Our AI serves the least among us first, reversing worldly priorities to reflect Kingdom values.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Addressing Concerns</h2>
    
    <h3>Common Questions</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Q: Doesn't technology dehumanize charity?</strong><br>
    A: When used properly, technology frees us from administrative burdens to focus more on human connection. Our volunteers spend less time on paperwork and more time in prayer and conversation with those we serve.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: What about job displacement?</strong><br>
    A: We use AI to augment human capabilities, not replace human workers. Every efficiency gained creates opportunities for deeper, more meaningful service.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: How do you prevent AI bias?</strong><br>
    A: Regular audits, diverse development teams, and constant prayer for wisdom. We also maintain human oversight of all critical decisions.</p>
    
    <h2>Research and Development</h2>
    
    <p>Our R&D team explores emerging technologies always asking: "How can this serve the poor?" Current areas of investigation include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Blockchain for transparent donation tracking</li>
        <li>Virtual reality for immersive volunteer training</li>
        <li>IoT sensors for real-time resource monitoring</li>
        <li>Quantum computing for complex optimization problems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Open Source Commitment</h2>
    
    <p>In the spirit of Christian generosity, we share our technological innovations freely. Our open-source tools are available to any organization seeking to serve others more effectively.</p>
