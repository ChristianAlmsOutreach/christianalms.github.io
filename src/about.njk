    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>{{ site.mission }}</p>
    
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a world where technology amplifies Christian charity, creating efficient, compassionate systems that serve the poor, feed the hungry, and bring hope to the hopeless. Through the marriage of ancient faith and modern innovation, we strive to be the hands and feet of Christ in the digital age.</p>
    
    <h2>Theological Foundation</h2>
    <p>Our work is rooted in the pre-schism Christian tradition, drawing from the wisdom of the early Church Fathers and the undivided Church of the first millennium. We believe that:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Faith and Reason Unite</strong>: As St. John Chrysostom taught, faith and reason are not opponents but partners in understanding God's will.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology is a Tool for Good</strong>: When guided by Christian ethics, technology can multiply our capacity to serve others.</li>
        <li><strong>Charity is Worship</strong>: Serving the poor is a form of liturgy, offering our work as a living sacrifice to God.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity in Diversity</strong>: We welcome Christians from all traditions who share our commitment to serving Christ through serving others.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>We combine three essential elements in our work:</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Traditional Faith</h3>
            <p>Grounded in 2,000 years of Christian wisdom, guided by scripture and tradition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Modern Technology</h3>
            <p>Leveraging AI, data science, and automation to maximize impact and efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Human Connection</h3>
            <p>Never losing sight of the personal touch that transforms charity into love.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2023, Christian Alms Outreach emerged from a simple observation: while technology was revolutionizing every aspect of modern life, charitable organizations were often left behind. A group of Christian technologists, theologians, and charity workers came together to bridge this gap.</p>
    
    <p>What started as a small pilot program using basic algorithms to optimize food distribution has grown into a comprehensive platform that serves thousands of families across multiple states. Our success has proven that faith-based organizations can be at the forefront of technological innovation while maintaining their spiritual mission.</p>
